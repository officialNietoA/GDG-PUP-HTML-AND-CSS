      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Nieto Alfonso, a web development cadet at GDG-PUP. I
        am 20 years old and from Quezon City, Philippines. I am eager to deepen
        my understanding of web development and look forward to gaining more
        knowledge and skills in this field.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am particularly interested in mastering front-end and back-end
        development, as well as learning the latest tools and technologies used
        in modern web development. My goal is to create user-friendly,
        responsive, and dynamic websites that provide excellent user
        experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my technical interests, I value collaboration and believe
        in the power of teamwork to solve complex problems. I also enjoy staying
        updated with industry trends and participating in web development
        communities to enhance my skills and network with like-minded
        individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, I aspire to work on innovative projects that make a
        meaningful impact, while continually challenging myself to grow as a
        developer.

      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        For my hobbies, I’m really into gaming! I spend my free time playing
        Mobile Legends, Minecraft, GTA V, and Left 4 Dead 2. I love how these
        games allow me to explore different worlds, compete with others, and
        have fun with friends. Aside from gaming, I also enjoy playing chess.
        It’s a relaxing yet challenging activity that helps me improve my focus,
        strategic thinking, and decision-making. These hobbies not only
        entertain me but also keep my mind active and engaged.
